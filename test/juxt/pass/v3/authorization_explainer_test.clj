;; As a warmup, let's start with some contrived data and demonstrate how
;; authorization works in Site.

;; In Site's authorization system, a subject might cause an action on a resource
;; (which might cause it to change in some way). The authorization system must
;; first check that the subject (user) is allowed to cause a given action on the
;; resource.

;; A long time ago, web servers supported 'user directories'. If you had an
;; account on a host and your username was 'alice', you could put files into a
;; public_html directory in your home directory and this would be published over
;; the WWW under http://host/~alice/. The tilde (~) indicates that the files
;; belong to the account owner. See
;; https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/public_html.html for further details.

;; We'll create a similar system here, using subjects/actions/resources.
