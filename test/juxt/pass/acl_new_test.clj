     ;; Each effect is associated, many-to-one, with a required (single)
     ;; scope. If an OpenAPI document defines an operation, that operation may
     ;; involve multiple effects, and the security requirement might require
     ;; multiple scopes. The security requirement of scopes may be implied
     ;; (and may affect the publishing of the openapi.json such that authors
     ;; don't need to concern themselves with declaring scope).

     ;; A effect such as 'https://example.org/effects/create-user' is registered in the database.

     ;; Since effects are themselves defined and stored in the database, they
     ;; can evolve over time (their behavior can be amended).

     ;; Scopes are an access token concern. An access token references an
     ;; application which references a particular API. Effects are therefore
     ;; part of the domain to which an API belongs. A GraphQL endpoint is
     ;; defined as part of an overall OpenAPI, which is the same group where
     ;; scopes, effects and rulesets are defined.
