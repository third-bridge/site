= Apex

The code in this part of the code-base has been copied and derived from Apex,
https://github.com/juxt/apex. The code is experimental and speculative, and
therefore hard to read in places. OpenAPI is a reasonably large domain and with
quite a few difficult open design choices in implementation. It is expected that
this code will be fully rewritten at some point once the design has stablised.

There are tests in the original code-base that might be copied over at some
point as part of a newer test suite.
