= Users Revisited
:toc: left
:experimental:

In <<ch-users>> we put Documents directly the database to represent an initial User.

Users are required to invoke Actions, but Actions are required to create Users,
so we had a chicken-and-egg situation that we resolved by directly inserting the
first user by hand.

However, now that we have built the capability to create Actions and
Permissions, we can build the Actions to create new Users, Identities and
Subjects. That's the subject of this chapter.
