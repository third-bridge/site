== Alternative choices rejected

=== Org Mode

org-mode was considered for the following benefits

* Better eediting experience in Emacs
* texinfo output

but rejected for the following reasons:

* No equivalent of https://asciidoctor.org/news/2013/09/18/introducing-asciidoctor-js-live-preview/[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview]
* JUXT's current standard is AsciiDoctor for documentation

In the future, we can get to texinfo by developing a custom Asciidoctor backend.
