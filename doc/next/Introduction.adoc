== What is Site?

Site is a place to keep records.

Records are documents, or other media such as pictures and videos.

Site provides access to records over HTTPS. Each record is therefore uniquely
identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) and accessible to user
applications over the HTTPS protocol.

Site allows applications to manage these records, via user-defined APIs.

Site can protect resources from unauthorized access, and log access to records
when required.

Site retains a full history.

== This book

This book teaches Site from 'the ground up'.

This is partly for pedagogical purposes. It is a good idea to learn in depth how
Site's builds up its secure foundation.

But if you are in a hurry, there are (or will be) quicker 'install packs' and
Docker images that provide shortcuts to setting up a Site instance.
